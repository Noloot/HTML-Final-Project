# HTML-Final-Project

In this project I learned many things this project showcase my understanding of creating and linking pages, adding a nav bar to each page that function for jumping from page to page, uploading images and sizing them so that they line up and take up the same amount of space, creating a table for connecting elements that go together, adding a google maps link to my page, and last but not least using CSS to make it all look uniform and clean.
